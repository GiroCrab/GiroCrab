  # `brew uninstall --zap` moves these to the Trash (recoverable until it is emptied).
  # This includes the encrypted vault (~/Library/Application Support/GiroCrab/tresor.girocrab).
  # Deliberately NOT touched: the iCloud Drive sync/mirror folder and the Keychain item
  # "de.girocrab.vault" that holds the vault key.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Your encrypted GiroCrab vault lives in
      ~/Library/Application Support/GiroCrab
    `brew uninstall --cask girocrab` keeps it.
    `brew uninstall --cask --zap girocrab` moves it to the Trash.
    Make a backup before zapping if you want to keep your data.
    Switching to beta/nightly inside the app works, but `brew upgrade --greedy`
    may then replace the newer in-app update with this cask's version. To change
    the channel for good, install girocrab@beta or girocrab@nightly instead.
